2. **Student Portal LMS** - Course enrollment and progress
3. **Admin Business Management** - Complete analytics
4. **Document Generation** - Template-to-PDF system

Should I start with completing the **Client Portal** first? We already have the structure in place, we just need to connect it to the APIs we've built and add the missing functionality.

Which component would you like me to tackle first?

- **Client Portal** → Full booking and appointment management
- **Student Portal** → Complete LMS with course enrollment
- **Admin Dashboard** → Business analytics and user management
- **Document System** → PDF generation and templates
- **Communication** → Email campaigns and notifications

Let's build this into the ultimate aesthetics business template! 🎨✨
