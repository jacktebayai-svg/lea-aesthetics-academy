# Architecture Decision: Prisma vs Supabase

## Current State Analysis

### What's Currently Using Prisma:
- `/api/public/availability` - Service availability checking
- `/api/public/treatments` - Treatment/service listings  
- `/api/public/bookings` - Appointment booking
- `/api/public/enrollments` - Course enrollments
- `/api/practitioner/dashboard` - Dashboard data
- `/api/stripe/*` - Payment processing
- Database schema management

### What's Currently Using Supabase:
- Authentication (`/api/auth/*`)
- Frontend auth provider (`auth-provider.tsx`)
- RLS policies and triggers
- Database hosting
- Storage buckets

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: Full Supabase (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Direct SQL queries with full PostgreSQL features
- ✅ Built-in RLS for security
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions  
- ✅ Integrated auth, storage, edge functions
- ✅ Better performance (no ORM overhead)
- ✅ Simpler auth flow (already configured)
- ✅ Master Aesthetics Suite spec suggests this approach
- ✅ Database triggers and functions work seamlessly
- ✅ No schema duplication between Prisma and Supabase

**Cons:**
- ❌ More manual SQL writing
- ❌ No automatic TypeScript types from schema
- ❌ Need to maintain type definitions manually

### Option 2: Prisma + Supabase Database
**Pros:**
- ✅ Type safety with Prisma types
- ✅ Familiar ORM patterns
- ✅ Database migrations through Prisma

**Cons:**
- ❌ Conflicts with Supabase RLS policies
- ❌ Can't use Supabase triggers effectively
- ❌ Duplicated schema definitions
- ❌ More complex auth integration
- ❌ Prisma Client adds overhead
- ❌ Real-time features harder to implement

## Decision: Go Full Supabase

Based on the Master Aesthetics Suite specification and the current project needs, **we should migrate to a pure Supabase approach**.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Create Supabase Helper Functions
1. Create typed query helpers for common operations
2. Build reusable API patterns for CRUD operations
3. Set up proper error handling

### Phase 2: Migrate API Routes
1. Replace Prisma imports with Supabase client
2. Convert Prisma queries to Supabase queries
3. Update error handling
4. Test each endpoint

### Phase 3: Remove Prisma Dependencies
1. Remove Prisma from package.json
2. Delete Prisma schema and migrations
3. Remove Prisma scripts
4. Clean up unused imports

### Phase 4: Enhance with Supabase Features
1. Add real-time subscriptions where useful
2. Implement edge functions for complex logic
3. Use Supabase Storage for file uploads
4. Leverage database functions for business logic

## Implementation Priority

High Priority (blocking other work):
- Services/treatments API
- Appointments/bookings API  
- Authentication consolidation
- Business settings API

Medium Priority:
- Course management APIs
- Payment processing
- Client/student management

Low Priority:
- Analytics and reporting
- Marketing automation
- Document management

## Benefits for Master Aesthetics Suite

1. **Single-tenant optimization**: RLS policies perfect for owner-managed business
2. **Real-time features**: Appointment updates, notifications
3. **Scalability**: Edge functions and CDN integration  
4. **Security**: Built-in RLS and auth
5. **Developer experience**: Less context switching between systems
6. **Cost efficiency**: Single platform vs multiple services
