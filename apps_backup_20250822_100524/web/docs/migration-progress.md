### 📋 Remaining High Priority Tasks

1. **Complete Stripe Payment Integration** - Update for Supabase schema
2. **Build Missing API Endpoints** - Clients, students, courses management
3. **Authentication Consolidation** - Remove all JWT dependencies

### 🛠 Technical Improvements Made

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for database operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with custom DatabaseError class
- **Performance**: Direct SQL queries vs ORM overhead
- **Security**: RLS policies enforced at database level
- **Scalability**: Supabase's built-in scaling capabilities

### 📈 Database Schema Highlights

- **16 Core Tables**: All required tables for Master Aesthetics Suite
- **Comprehensive Types**: 13 custom enum types for data integrity
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints and references
- **Triggers**: Automated user profile creation on registration
- **Policies**: Role-based access control (owner/client/student)
- **Storage**: 5 storage buckets for different file types

### 🏗 Code Architecture Improvements

- **Helper Functions**: 20+ reusable database operations
- **Type Definitions**: Complete interface definitions for all tables
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all APIs
- **Authentication**: Centralized auth checking functions

### 📊 API Migration Status

| API Route | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `/api/public/treatments` | ✅ Complete | Fully migrated to Supabase |
| `/api/public/availability` | ✅ Complete | Fully migrated to Supabase |
| `/api/public/bookings` | ✅ Complete | Completely rewritten |
| `/api/business/settings` | ✅ Complete | New single-tenant API |
| `/api/public/enrollments` | 🔄 Needs Migration | Still using Prisma + JWT |
| `/api/stripe/*` | 🔄 Needs Migration | Still using Prisma + JWT |
| `/api/practitioner/dashboard` | 🔄 Needs Migration | Still using Prisma + JWT |

### 🚀 Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Remove JWT Dependencies** - Replace with Supabase Auth in remaining APIs
2. **Migrate Enrollments API** - Convert to Supabase for course enrollment
3. **Update Stripe Integration** - Align with new appointment/payment schema
4. **Test API Endpoints** - Comprehensive testing of migrated routes
5. **Update Frontend** - Ensure frontend components work with new API structure

### 💾 Backup and Safety
