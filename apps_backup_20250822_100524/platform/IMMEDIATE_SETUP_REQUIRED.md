# 🚨 IMMEDIATE SETUP REQUIRED

## Database is 70% configured but missing critical tables

### Step 1: Complete Database Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: 
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fljkbvzytsjkwlywbeyg

2. **Go to SQL Editor** → "New Query"

3. **Copy and paste** the entire content of `supabase/fix-missing-tables.sql`

4. **Click "Run"**

### Step 2: Verify Setup Works

```bash
node scripts/test-master-aesthetics-setup.js
```

You should see all 14 tables with ✅ status.

### Step 3: Continue Development

Once verified, we can continue with the systematic implementation:

1. ✅ **Database Setup** (you just completed this)
2. 🔄 **Resolve Prisma vs Supabase architecture** (next)
3. 🔄 **Consolidate authentication** 
4. 🔄 **Build booking system**
5. 🔄 **And so on...**

## Why This Step is Critical

Without the complete database:
- ❌ User registration fails
- ❌ API routes throw errors  
- ❌ Booking system can't work
- ❌ Course enrollment impossible
- ❌ Payment processing broken

**This 5-minute database setup unlocks all development.**
