What are Anti-Wrinkle Injections? Anti-wrinkle injections use a purified protein to temporarily relax
specific facial muscles, reducing the appearance of dynamic lines and wrinkles. This is a prescription-only
medicine that must be prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner.
Suitability This treatment may be suitable for you if:
• You have dynamic wrinkles (appear with muscle movement)
• You are over 18 years of age
• You have realistic expectations
• You are in good general health
